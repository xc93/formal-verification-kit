# binary_search(a, x) — formally specified & verified

**Status:** constructed (escalation-bounded)

Iterative binary search over a sorted list. Precondition `isSorted(a)`; the loop invariant narrows the window and maintains 'if x is in a then x is in a[lo:hi]'. The 'found' half (`return i => a[i]==x`) is bundled-tier clean; the 'not present' half (membership over a sorted list) needs an inductive/quantified array predicate.

**Demonstrates:** Arrays with a **sortedness precondition** (mirror of insertion-sort's postcondition) and a **narrowing-window** invariant. The found half is clean; the not-present/membership half escalates.

**Key findings:** `mid=(lo+hi)//2` — no overflow in Python, but the historic **C/Java overflow bug** on a fixed-width port; an unstated sortedness precondition (unsorted input gives a silent false negative).
