# gcd(a, b) — formally specified & verified

**Status:** constructed (escalation-bounded)

Euclid's algorithm. The loop invariant is that `gcd(a,b)` is *preserved* (`gcd(a,b)=gcd(b, a mod b)`), and the variant `b` strictly decreases (clean termination). Proving the result *is* the gcd rests on the number-theoretic identity, which is beyond the bundled simplification tier.

**Demonstrates:** Loop invariant is a **preserved relation** (`gcd(a,b)` is invariant), not an accumulator; clean termination (variant `b`). Full correctness needs the number-theoretic Euclid identity.

**Key findings:** Missing `a,b >= 0` precondition — floor-mod makes `gcd(12,-8)` return `-4`; `gcd(0,0)=0` is the conventional value. The Euclid identity is the escalation obligation.
