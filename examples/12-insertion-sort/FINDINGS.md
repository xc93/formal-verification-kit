# Findings report — `insertion_sort.py` (in-place)

Plain-language findings from formalizing [`insertion_sort.py`](insertion_sort.py).
Each is `input → observed vs expected`. **Non-blocking** — this report never edits
or deletes your code; it is advice. These findings **do not** depend on
machine-checking the proof — they are solid today. The concrete cases below were
**executed** against the actual code (not just reasoned about).

> **This is the IN-PLACE variant.** Unlike the kit's copy-based sibling
> (`examples/12-insertion-sort/`, which does `result = list(array)`), this version
> sorts the parameter `a` directly with nested `while` loops and index assignment,
> then `return a`. The headline behavioral consequence is **Finding 4 (mutation)**,
> which *replaces* the copy version's no-mutation property.

## Finding 1 — missing precondition: elements must form a total order (real bug with NaN / mixed types)

Writing a clean contract forces the question "what does `<`/`>` mean on the
elements?" The code silently assumes the elements are **pairwise comparable and
totally ordered**. Two concrete ways that fails:

- **`float('nan')` poisons the order.** Every comparison with NaN is `False`, so
  the inner guard `a[j] > key` never fires across a NaN and the element is never
  moved. Executed:

  | input | code returns (observed) | expected (sorted) | agree? |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `[3, float('nan'), 1]` | `[3, nan, 1]` (3 precedes 1) | a sorted order | not sorted |

  The output places `3` before `1` — it is **not** sorted. This is the direct
  analogue of the sum example's missing `n >= 0`: a silently-assumed precondition
  that, when violated, makes the function disagree with its own intent.

- **Mixed incomparable types raise.** `insertion_sort([1, "a"])` raises
  `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'`
  (executed, Python 3). The function is only defined on a domain of
  mutually-orderable elements.

**Recommendation:** document/enforce the precondition "elements are mutually
comparable and the order is total (no NaN)." The formal contract `(SORT)` makes
this explicit by **modeling elements as `Int`** (a total order); the gap between
"generic element" and "`Int`" is exactly this finding.

## Finding 2 — spec-difficulty signal: the load-bearing invariant side conditions

As in the sum example (`I <= N+1`), writing the loop circularities **forced**
side conditions that are not in the source text — and each marks a real boundary:

- `(OUTER)` needs `1 <= i <= len` and `isSorted(a[0:i])`. The lower bound `i >= 1`
  is why `i` starts at `1`, not `0` (a 1-element prefix is sorted for free — the
  proof's base case). Start `i` at `0` and the first comparison `a[-1]` would wrap
  (Python negative index!) — see Finding 6.
- `(INNER)` needs `-1 <= j < i < len` and the **hole-multiset** condition. The
  `j >= -1` lower bound is what the guard `j >= 0` protects: the read `a[j]` is
  only reached while `j >= 0`, so the loop never indexes out of range. This is a
  *positive* finding — the code's guard ordering (`j >= 0` **before** `a[j] > key`,
  relying on `and` short-circuit) is exactly what keeps every index in bounds, and
  it keeps the index **positive** (never a Python negative-index wrap-around). The
  in-bounds VC this generates is **linear**, so the bundled Z3 tier discharges it.

These are not bugs; they are the silent assumptions the formal lens surfaces.

## Finding 3 — stability hinges on the **strict** `>` in the inner guard (subtle, intent-relevant)

The guard is `a[j] > key` (**strict**), so an element equal to `key` does **not**
shift — equal elements keep their original relative order. The sort is therefore
**stable**. Executed (keys comparing on a hidden field, tags showing origin):
`[1a, 1b, 0c, 1d]` -> `[0c, 1a, 1b, 1d]` — the three `1`s stay in input order
`a, b, d`.

Had the guard been `a[j] >= key`, the function would still be correct (a sorted
permutation) but **no longer stable**. This `>` vs `>=` choice is load-bearing for
stability and invisible to a quick read — the kind of property formalization makes
explicit. **Recommendation:** if stability is intended (it often is the reason to
pick insertion sort), state it in the docstring and keep a test that would catch a
regression to `>=`.

## Finding 4 — input IS mutated (in-place); the returned object is the input object (behavioral contract change vs the copy version)

**This is the headline behavioral finding and it *replaces* the copy version's
no-mutation property.** There is no `result = list(a)` here: the loops mutate the
parameter `a` directly via index assignment, and `return a` hands back the very
same object. Executed:

| input | argument after the call (observed) | `ret is arg`? |
|---|---|---|
| `a = [3, 1, 2]` | `[1, 2, 3]` (mutated in place) | **True** |

So `insertion_sort` has a **side effect**: the caller's list is rearranged, and
`insertion_sort(x) is x`. The program's own `__main__` even asserts this
(`insertion_sort(b) is b`).

**Why this matters / recommendation:**
- A caller who still needs the original order must copy *before* calling
  (`insertion_sort(list(a))`), or expect their data to be reordered.
- If non-mutation was ever desired, this is a **bug-shaped behavioral mismatch**
  vs the copy version — call it out in the docstring ("sorts in place; returns the
  same list").
- **Modeling note:** K's `List` is a *value* sort, not a heap reference. The
  *value-level* effect (the final sequence is a sorted permutation) is captured
  faithfully by `(SORT)`. The *reference-level* identity `insertion_sort(x) is x`
  (same object) is **not** expressible in a value-sort model and is therefore a
  reported finding, not a modeled property. (Contrast: in the copy version this
  same value-sort fact made *non-mutation* hold by construction; here, with the
  copy removed, the model instead leaves the aliasing identity as an out-of-model
  finding.)

## Finding 5 — spec-difficulty = ESCALATION signal: sorting is beyond the bundled fast path (NOT a code bug)

This is honest scope, not a defect in your code. A *clean* postcondition for
sorting needs two **non-arithmetic** predicates:

- **sortedness** — universally quantified / inductively defined over the list;
- **permutation** — **multiset** equality of input and output.

The kit's bundled simplification tier (exact-halving of even products +
map-extensionality) discharges *polynomial/linear* VCs, not multiset-preservation
or sorted-prefix-composition. The kit itself flags "array / list loop" as a
**roadmap** example shape and "recursive data structures / inductively-defined
predicates (often `mu`)" as an **escalation** case. So:

- The semantics and all three claims are **constructed and well-formed**.
- Two classes of VC are left as explicit `[ESCALATION BOUNDARY]` obligations in
  [`mini-python-spec.k`](mini-python-spec.k): (L1) multiset change under one
  index-update, (L2) sorted-prefix composition. They are **not** admitted as
  `[trusted]` — doing so would fake confidence the kit does not have.
- **Route (per [`../../knowledge/sources.md`](../../knowledge/sources.md)):**
  OOPSLA'20 (unified fixpoint reasoning over inductive data structures) and LICS'19
  (Matching mu-Logic) for the `mu`-defined `sorted`/multiset predicates and their
  lemmas. The most reliable fix is a **worked array/list example** added to the
  kit — this function is a good candidate once those lemmas exist.

## Finding 6 — corner cases that are handled correctly (deliberate non-findings)

Stated because a reviewer will ask:

- **Empty list** `[]` -> `[]`: outer guard `1 < len([]) == 0` is false, loop never
  runs. (Executed.)
- **Single element** `[7]` -> `[7]`: `1 < 1` false. (Executed.)
- **Already sorted / reverse sorted / duplicates / negatives**: all handled
  (covered by the `__main__` asserts; e.g. `[5,4,3,2,1]` -> `[1,2,3,4,5]`,
  `[-1,-3,2,0]` -> `[-3,-1,0,2]`, `[3,3,1,2,1]` -> `[1,1,2,3,3]`). (Executed.)
- **No index-out-of-bounds**: the inner guard's `j >= 0` (short-circuiting before
  `a[j]`) and `i` starting at `1` keep every index in `[0, len)` — never negative.
  (See Finding 2 — starting `i` at `0` would read `a[-1]`, Python's *last*
  element, a silent wrap-around; the code correctly avoids it by starting at `1`.)

## Note — termination (partial vs total correctness)

The contract is **partial correctness**: it says nothing about halting. Both loops
clearly terminate: the **outer** measure `len - i` strictly decreases by 1 per
iteration (bounded below by 0); the **inner** measure `j + 1` strictly decreases
each iteration (`j` decrements; bounded below by 0, and the loop also exits when
`a[j] <= key`). **Recommendation-only:** if you want it proved, add those two
variants to `(OUTER)`/`(INNER)` and discharge "strictly decreases, bounded below"
alongside the existing VCs. Not attempted unless you ask.

---

*Next: run `/verify` to construct the proof of `(SORT)`/`(OUTER)`/`(INNER)` and get
the test-redundancy recommendation (benefit 1). Expect `/verify` to land cleanly on
the structure and the in-bounds/linear VCs, and to **stop at the `[ESCALATION
BOUNDARY]`** multiset/sortedness lemmas (Finding 5) — that stop is the honest
signal, not a failure.*
