# Formal Verification Kit

**Prove your code correct for *all* inputs — and let your AI agent do the work.**

Point any coding agent at this repo and run `/formalize` then `/verify` on your
code. You get two concrete wins even if you have never heard of "formal
verification":

## Benefit 1 — Fewer tests, faster CI

A formally verified function is proven correct for **every** input in its
specified domain — not just the handful your unit tests happen to check. So the
tests that merely re-check input/output cases the spec already covers become
**redundant**.

After `/verify`, the kit tells you exactly **which existing tests are now
subsumed** by the proof and recommends removing them, with an estimate of the CI
time saved. It is conservative and **recommendation-only** — it never deletes a
test, and (because the MVP constructs proofs but does not yet machine-check them,
see [Honest status](#honest-status)) it advises you to run the emitted
`kprove` commands first, or keep the tests until you do. Tests outside the spec's
domain, plus termination, performance, and integration tests, are always kept.

## Benefit 2 — Finds hidden, subtle bugs

You get this one **even if you never read a single line of the proof.**

The act of writing a precise specification routinely flushes out **missing
preconditions, forgotten corner cases, and undefined behavior** — the empty
input, the zero, the negative number, the off-by-one, the overflow. And here is
the key signal: **if a clean specification is hard or impossible to write, that
is itself strong evidence the code has a bug or a forgotten case.**

The kit reports all of this in plain language as a **Findings report** —
`input → observed vs expected` — readable by any developer. This is the primary
day-one value for people who don't care what formal verification is.

## What it is

A standalone, **provider-neutral** public repo of plain-markdown files. There is
nothing to install and no SDK to wire up. Any coding agent that can read a repo
(Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Codex, …) can use it, because the two
"commands" are just conventions defined in a markdown file the agent reads.

## Quick start — copy/paste to your agent

Bring this kit to code you've **already written**. You don't need K, a prover, or
anything installed. In your project, paste these to your coding agent, in order.

**1. Teach it the kit** (works with any agent — Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, Codex, …):

> Learn the Formal Verification Kit at https://github.com/grosu/formal-verification-kit
> — read its `AGENTS.md` and follow the BOOTSTRAP (read the `knowledge/` primers) so
> you actually learn it, not just skim the README. Tell me when you're ready.

*If your agent can't browse the web, first run `git clone
https://github.com/grosu/formal-verification-kit`, then paste:* "Read
`./formal-verification-kit/AGENTS.md` and follow it. Tell me when you're ready."

**2. (Recommended) Sanity-check the plan before any files are written:**

> Before writing any files, walk me through the spec and the loop invariant(s) you
> intend to write, and any concerns — no artifacts yet.

**3. Find the specs — and the bugs:**

> run /formalize

*Say **run /formalize**, not a bare `/formalize` — some agents (Claude Code, etc.)
treat a leading `/` as a built-in slash command and reject an unknown one.*

Then read the **Findings report** — the missing preconditions, corner cases, and
likely bugs it surfaced. (You get this even if you never read the proof.)

**4. Construct the proof — and trim redundant tests:**

> run /verify

Then read the **proof** and the **test-redundancy** recommendation (which tests the
proof makes redundant).

> **Tip:** append *"be exhaustive and adversarially verify this"* to steps 3–4 to
> make the agent cross-check itself — the proofs are *constructed, not yet
> machine-checked* (see [Honest status](#honest-status)).

Both commands need **no arguments** — they operate on the whole project (each
function and each loop). It works with **any** agent that reads `AGENTS.md`; it does
not have to be Claude Code.

## What you get

Running `/formalize` then `/verify` produces, written alongside your code:

- **Formal specifications** — a K reachability claim (pre/post-condition) for
  each function, and a **loop-invariant circularity** for each loop.
- **A constructed correctness proof** — symbolic execution of your code through
  the semantics, discharging the loop invariant, and checking the leftover
  arithmetic.
- **`.k` artifacts + run-commands** — the claim/semantics files and the exact
  `kompile` / `kprove` commands to machine-check the proof later.
- **A Findings report** (Benefit 2) — plain-language bugs, missing
  preconditions, and corner cases, each with a concrete example.
- **A test-redundancy recommendation** (Benefit 1) — which tests the proof makes
  redundant, and which to keep.

This is one of a **growing library of worked examples** — browse the catalog in
[`examples/`](examples/). Each takes a real function from source code all the way
to a constructed proof, file for file. The first members are the **`sum-*`
cluster** — [`sum-up/`](examples/02-sum-up/) and [`sum-down/`](examples/03-sum-down/)
compute the *same* contract (`n·(n+1)/2`) by counting **up** vs. **down**, showing
that **the proof obligations differ even when the spec does not**. More are added
over time — and the vetted, machine-checked ones double as the fine-tuning corpus
for the product. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) for the catalog and
how to add your own.

## <a id="honest-status"></a>Honest status (MVP)

This is a first MVP, optimized for reach. We are upfront about what it does *not*
yet do:

- **Constructs the proof, does not run it.** `/verify` builds the proof and emits
  the exact `kompile`/`kprove` commands, but **does not invoke the toolchain**.
  Artifacts are clearly labeled **"constructed, not machine-checked."** Test
  removal is therefore a recommendation *conditioned on* you running those
  commands. (The Findings report does **not** depend on machine-checking and is
  solid today.)
- **Fragment ("mini-X") semantics.** For the MVP, the kit generates a minimal K
  semantics covering only the constructs your code actually uses — exactly as the
  `sum` example builds a *mini Python*. This is a deliberate stopgap. Wiring in
  **full, real per-language K semantics** (so the literal program is verified
  against the real language) is the roadmap.
- **Partial correctness by default.** The proof establishes correctness *if the
  function returns*; termination is surfaced as a recommendation, not proved
  unless asked.

The distilled primers in [`knowledge/`](knowledge/) are a **fast path** for
common cases. When your case exceeds them (recursive data structures, binders,
concurrency, …), [`knowledge/sources.md`](knowledge/sources.md) is the
first-class escalation path — it routes you to the right primary source by topic,
and an optional `--refresh` re-fetches them live.

## The vision

The end state is a **fine-tuned model** that already knows full language
semantics, the [K framework](https://kframework.org), matching logic, and the
proof techniques — so that **one line in yields a verified program out**, with
zero extra effort. This MVP approximates that today with bundled knowledge plus
an agent-driven workflow.
