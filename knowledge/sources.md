# Sources — live index for `--refresh` and citations

**The first-class escalation path.** The three sibling primers ([`matching-logic.md`](matching-logic.md), [`k-framework.md`](k-framework.md), [`reachability-and-circularities.md`](reachability-and-circularities.md)) are a **fast path** — the common cases (a function with a loop, a numeric contract, an arithmetic VC), instant and offline. They are distillations, not the full theory. When the recipe doesn't cover your case, read the primary source for that topic here. The [WHEN TO ESCALATE](#when-to-escalate) table routes you by topic; `--refresh` re-fetches these URLs into context for the current run.

Every citation used anywhere in `knowledge/` resolves to an entry below.

The matching-logic.org landing page: an intro essay plus footnotes linking the papers. See also the JLAMP "Matching Logic Explained" paper, whose footnotes route to the `fsl.cs.illinois.edu` PDFs below.

## Papers — `https://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/publications/<slug>.pdf`

Append `<slug>.pdf` to the base URL. These are the authoritative citations; cite by slug.

| Slug | Title | What it underpins |
|---|---|---|
| `rosu-2017-lmcs` | Matching Logic (LMCS 2017) | the foundational paper: patterns-as-sets, the definedness ladder, the proof system. The default citation for matching logic. |
| `chen-rosu-2019-lics` | Matching μ-Logic (LICS 2019) | adds set variables + least fixpoint `μ` (Knaster–Tarski) → induction, recursion, reachability. |
| `chen-lucanu-rosu-2020-tr` | Initial Algebra Semantics in Matching Logic (TR) | modern μ-era presentation; initial-algebra / inductive-sort semantics. |
| `rosu-stefanescu-2012-fm` | From Hoare Logic to Matching Logic Reachability (FM 2012) | reachability rules `φ ⇒ φ'` generalizing Hoare triples; one semantics for execution + proof. |
| `rosu-stefanescu-ciobaca-moore-2013-lics` | One-Path Reachability Logic (LICS 2013) | the **Circularity** rule (coinductive loop invariants) and the full proof system. |
| `chen-pena-rodrigues-rosu-trinh-2020-oopsla` | Unified fixpoint reasoning (OOPSLA 2020) | reasoning about **inductive / recursive data structures** (heap predicates, lists, trees). |
| `chen-rosu-2020-icfp` | A General Approach to Define Binders (ICFP 2020) | **binders, scoping, α-equivalence** (λ, quantifiers, local variables). |

## K framework

- Source + issues: `https://github.com/runtimeverification/k`
- **User manual** (deep K syntax reference): in-repo `docs/user_manual.md` (on disk this run: `/tmp/kdocs/user_manual.md`).
- **Lesson 1.22 — "Basics of Deductive Program Verification using K"**: the canonical worked proof (the `sum`-style example `examples/02-sum-up` imitates). Path (under `k-distribution/k-tutorial/`, Lesson 22 by K's `1_basic` numbering): `k-distribution/k-tutorial/1_basic/22_proofs`; full tutorial at `https://kframework.org/k-distribution/k-tutorial/` (on disk: `/tmp/kdocs/L22_proofs.md`).
- Project site: `https://kframework.org`
- **Full per-language semantics** also live in the K ecosystem (KEVM, the C semantics, Python/JS efforts) under the `runtimeverification` org — the roadmap target that replaces the MVP's mini-X fragment.

## <a id="when-to-escalate"></a>WHEN TO ESCALATE

| Topic the recipe doesn't cover | Go to |
|---|---|
| Recursive heap predicates / linked structures (lists, trees) | `chen-pena-rodrigues-rosu-trinh-2020-oopsla` (OOPSLA'20); separation logic *as one matching-logic theory* is sketched in `rosu-2017-lmcs` (not the paper's headline result) |
| Binders, scoping, α-equivalence (λ, quantifiers, locals) | `chen-rosu-2020-icfp` (ICFP'20) |
| Induction / least-fixpoint `μ` reasoning, well-founded data | `chen-rosu-2019-lics` (LICS'19); inductive sorts in `chen-lucanu-rosu-2020-tr` |
| Reachability rule mechanics, the **Circularity** rule, soundness | `rosu-stefanescu-2012-fm` (FM'12) + `rosu-stefanescu-ciobaca-moore-2013-lics` (LICS'13) |
| Definedness / equality / membership / sort axioms, the proof system | `rosu-2017-lmcs` (LMCS'17) |
| Deep / unfamiliar K syntax, attributes, hooks, backends | `docs/user_manual.md` |
| A worked, end-to-end `kprove` claim to imitate | Lesson 1.22 (`22_proofs`) |
| Concurrency, or any topic none of the above clearly covers | start at `matching-logic.org` (via `curl -sk`) and follow its footnotes |

## `--refresh`

`/formalize --refresh` and `/verify --refresh` re-fetch the URLs above — `matching-logic.org` (via `curl -sk`), the relevant `fsl.cs.illinois.edu` PDF(s) for the topic at hand, and the K manual / Lesson 1.22 — into the current run's context, instead of relying only on the bundled primers. Opt-in; the default is the offline fast path.
